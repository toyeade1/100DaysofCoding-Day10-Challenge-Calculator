# 100DaysofCoding-Day11-Challenge-Calculator

In this exercise we created a calculator that allows the user to insert a first number, the operator they will be using and then a second number. It also allows the user to choose to do another calculation either based on the old answer or another new input.

I provided 2 methods to find the calculations but the Day10Calculator is more efficient
